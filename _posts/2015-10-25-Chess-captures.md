To get started, I want to show you my latest piece of data analysis. I analyzed [the millionbase](http://www.top-5000.nl/pgn.htm).
A large dataset of aproximately 2.2 million chess games. There have been several people who analyzed the millionbase,
such as the [Chess Piece Journeys](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/37yg35/chess_piece_journeys_album_oc/),
and [Survival of Pieces in Chess](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/2jrwgw/survival_of_pieces_in_chess/) 
that was first posted in Quora. Inspired by these, I decided to analyze how pieces are captured on the Chess Board. The
result is the following visualization:
